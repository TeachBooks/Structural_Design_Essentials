    "## Rules of thumb\n",
    "The 'rules of thumb' (Dutch: 'vuistregels') are to be seen as a quick way to estimate dimensions of structural members, mostly based on span. These *estimated* dimensions serve as input only for a early design stage calculation (e.g. check of capacity or deformation), after which you will use more advanced design rules (e.g. Eurocode) for a more accurate calculation. Mind that you should *not* use them the other way around, as if the rules of thumb were some law that should be respected.\n",
