    "## Introduction\n",
    "A structure should be sufficiently safe. This means that the probability of failure should be sufficiently low, but unfortunately enough it can never be 0 %. It is possible to determine the risk of failure of a structure (or more positively formulated: the structural reliability ) by carrying out a probabilistic calculation. There are 3 methods of calculations to deal with uncertainty, with increasing level of complexity (International Organization for Standardization 11 2015). Those are:\n",
    "- **Semi-probabilistic approach**: Safety format prescribing the design equations and the analysis procedures to be used default method in the Eurocodes, i.e. to be used for usual design situations.\n",
    "- **Reliability-based design and assessment**: Reliability requirements to fulfil unusual design situations in regard to uncertainties, code calibration.\n",
    "- **Risk-informed decision making**: Decisions are taken with due consideration of the total risks (e.g. loss of lives, injuries). Exceptional design situations in regard to uncertainties and consequences. Derivation of reliability requirements.\n",

    "## Reliability index $\\beta$\n",
    "The annual probability of failure $P_{f;a}$ and the annual reliability index $\\beta_{a}$ are used in the Eurocode as the two standard metrics to express structural reliability in the semi-probabilistic approach. The index $a$ (annum) is often left out, since variable loads are represented by the probability distributions of their *yearly* extreme values. The table below provides the values for both metrics:\n",

    "To prevent the design of every single structure resulting in a fully probabilistic undertaking, however, for most structures a simplified approach is allowed. Eurocode 0 (prNEN-EN-1990 2021) describes such a simplified, semi-probabilistic method, in which the stochastic distributions of material strength and load values are expressed by characteristic values, taking into account their spread, and by partial safety factors, that ensure sufficient safety margin between loads and capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Eurocode defines partial factors for the Effects side (actions) in the prNEN-EN-1990 (2021), while the partial factors on the Resistance side (materials) are defined in the various material codes for steel, concrete, timber, and so forth. This Load/Resistance Factor (LRF) or split factor format approach is used to allocate the different uncertainty of loads (effects) and uncertainty of resistance (strength) where they belong, that is in separate calculations of design values of loads and resistance, respectively.\n",

This is a standard statistic operation that is done by adding or subtracting $1.64·σ$ in case of a normal distribution. For loads or materials other distributions may apply, such as Weibull or lognormal distributions.\n",

The design values are found by multiplying /dividing the characteristic values with the partial safety factors $γ_E$ and $γ_R$.
