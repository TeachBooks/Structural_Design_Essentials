    "Estimation rules also exist for columns, but especially for these elements, the actual dimensions required can be very different from those found with these estimation rules. The dimensions of the column depend strongly on the buckling length. However, there is a big difference whether a column has to support an entire building with many floors or just the roof. Often, the column at ground level is the ‘dimensional’ column. A slender column with large buckling length could also be normative, even if it is not on the ground floor.\n",

All beams within the shaded areas transfer their load to the column. We also show the length dimensions so that the total load to be carried by the column can be easily determined.
