For the section between the support points, the same rules apply as for a normal beam on two supports.

    "The strength of the beam section between the supports proves to be critical for this beam. By using a higher strength class, S355, a slightly more slender profile can be used: HE300A. In that case, the deflection of the beam section between the supports becomes critical. A more slender profile (HE280A) is possible if there are no walls on the beam so that the normal deflection requirement applies: $w_{bij, norm}=0.003 \\cdot l_{uit}$.\n",

    "For this beam, the support moment and the settlement at the end of the cantilever are not critical. This means that the cantilever can be made slightly longer. With an HE300A, the cantilever can be 0.2 metres longer: $l_{uit}=2.2 [m]$. By using an HE320A, the cantilever can even be half a metre longer: $l_{uit}=2.5 [m]$. The deflection of the cantilever then becomes critical.\n"
