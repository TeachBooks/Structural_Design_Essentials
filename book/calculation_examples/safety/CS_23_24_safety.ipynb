    "This page provides an overview of Part 1 of the assignment for the course Concrete and Steel Structures (CTB2220-14) as published for students in the 2023-2024 academic year during the second quarter. The aim is to serve as an additional example, offering students greater insight into the portion of the course that focuses on safety. Various parameters in the assignment are dependent on the last three digits of the student number. These parameters are denoted as **X, Y, and Z (1234XYZ)**. Since this assignment serves as an example, the parameters have been set to **X = 0, Y = 0, and Z = 0** in this solution.\n",

    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In a picturesque town on the outskirts of Amsterdam stands the home of Mr and Mrs Van Wijk. A charming family house with a concrete structure that has already gathered many memories. When their family expanded, they decided it was time for more space. The question that occupied their minds was how to add an extra floor without placing too much strain on the existing structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr Van Wijk approached our structural engineering firm for advice. Our colleague, Maria, came up with the brilliant idea of using a lightweight steel structure. She believed this would be the perfect solution to add an additional floor without requiring drastic alterations to the existing concrete structure and foundation. Her design was innovative and promised to provide the Van Wijk family with the space they needed, without having to completely renovate their home.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, Maria became involved in another urgent project and had to step away from this design. That’s when you, as her colleague, take up the challenge of bringing her vision to life. You delve deeper into Maria’s design and begin to work out the details.\n",

Additional design drawings can be found in {ref}`content:AppendixA:labels`. \n",

The ground floor has a height of **4 metres**, the first floor has a height of **3 metres**, and the second floor has a height of **2.8 metres**, as shown in {numref}`figure3`. The centre-to-centre distance between the columns in the longitudinal direction is **5 metres**, while the span in the transverse direction depends on your student number (X), as indicated in {numref}`span_X`.

    "In this assignment, wind load is excluded, except for the upward wind acting on the cantilevered beam. Typically, wind has a significant influence on the design of elements such as roof beams and stability components.

    "Variable loads in indoor spaces account for loads from occupants, furniture, etc. A distinction is made between indoor loads and loads on the terrace.\n",
    "\n",
    "The characteristic load value for floors is **$g_{k} = 1.75 kN/m^2$**. However, because the space is large and the homeowners want the flexibility to rearrange and remodel the spaces, non-load-bearing walls have been chosen. These movable partitions can be placed anywhere on the floor. The lightest partition wall is considered and is accounted for as a uniformly distributed load of **0.5 kN/m²**. This brings the total (indoor) floor load to **$\\mathbf{g_{k,imposed,floor} = 2.25 kN/m^2}$**.\n",
