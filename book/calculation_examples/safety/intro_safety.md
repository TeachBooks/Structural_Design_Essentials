# Safety

This chapter explores the reliability of a structure as a result of the stochastic spread of both effects (loads) and resistance (capacity), examining the Probability Density Functions of both. Further, this chapter includes an elaborated assignment from the bachelor course 'concrete and steel structures' from the academic year 2023-2024, providing practical insights into safety principles in a realistic application.
